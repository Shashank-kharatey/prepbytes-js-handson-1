    <h3>----OPERATORS & EXPRESSIONS----</h3>
    <p>Q.1 You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers. Note: You have to complete AddTwoNumbers function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.1 const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
        return (a+b)
      };</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Q.2 You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions ( A < 10 and A > B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators. Note: You have to complete Is_Valid function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.2 const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
        if(a<10 && a>b){
          return true
        }
        else {
          return false
        }
      };</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Q.3 You are given two numbers 
        A and B. You need to do the following checks: <br>
        1. if both are divisible by 10 console true. <br>
        2. if both are not divisible by 10 console false. <br>
        3. if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true. <br> Use operator to do this. Note: You have to complete Check function. No need to take any input</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.3 const Check = (A, B) => 
        {
          if (A%10==0 && B%10==0) {
            return true
          }
           else if (A%10!=0 && B%10!=0) {
            return false
          }
            else {
            return true
          }
        };</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Q.4 You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number. Note: You have to complete First_Digit function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.4 const First_Digit = (n) => {
        var a=n/1000
        var b=parseInt(a)
        return b
      };</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Q.5 You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number. Note: You have to complete Last_Digit function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.5 const Last_Digit = (n) => {
        var a=n%10
        return a
     };</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Q.6 You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as divisor and B as dividend.Your task is find the remainder. Note: You have to complete Find_the_remainder function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.6 const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
        var c=b%a
        return c
    };</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Q.7 You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.Note: You have to complete Multiply_two_number function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.7 const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {
        var c=a*b
        return c
    };</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Q.8 Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as 
        A,B, and C (out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average. Note: You have to complete Sum and Average functions. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.8 const Sum = (A, B, C) => 
        {
         var c=A+B+C
         return c
        };
        
        const Average = (A, B, C) => 
        {
         var d=(A+B+C)/3
         return d
        };</pre>
